# prospect-plaza
My master's thesis project at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Can be viewed at champebarton.github.io/prospect-plaza. Mobile functionality for graphic not yet in place. Two more graphics yet to be implemented. Photos to come. WHAT YOU'LL READ IS A FIRST DRAFT, AND HAS ONLY UNDERGONE MINOR REVISIONS AND FACT-CHECKING. Deeper editing and revising to be completed before the middle of April.

All styling for the piece was borrowed from The Pudding (https://github.com/the-pudding/dress_codes) and used only for purposes of demonstration. The code for this piece, in its current form, is not meant to exist outside of this github or detached from this disclaimer. The words are mine, as is the code for the single data visualization within.
